        <h2>History</h2>



        <div class="srt">
            <p>The Snake variety of games dates back to the arcade game Blockade, developed and published by
                Gremlin in
                1976. In 1978, Atari, Inc. released, as an unofficial port, an early home console version of the
                Blockade
                concept, titled Surround. Surround was one of the nine Atari 2600 (VCS) launch titles, and was also sold
                by
                Sears under the name Chase. That same year, a similar game was launched for the Bally Astrocade as
                Checkmate.</p>

                The first known personal computer version of Snake, titled Worm, was programmed in 1978 by Peter
                Trefonas of
                the US on the TRS-80 computer, and published by CLOAD magazine in the same year. This was followed
                shortly
                afterwards with versions from the same author for the Commodore PET and Apple II computers. A
                microcomputer
                port of Hustle was first written by Peter Trefonas in 1979 and published by CLOAD. This was later
                released
                by Milton Bradley for the TI-99/4A in 1980.

                There were several versions of Snake on the BBC Micro. 1982's Snake by Dave Bresnen was different in
                that
                the snake was controlled using the left and right arrow keys relative to the direction it was heading
                in.
                The snake increases in speed as it gets longer, and there are no "lives", making achieving a high score
                or
                reaching higher levels relatively difficult as one mistake means starting from the beginning.

                A variant called Nibbles was included with MS-DOS for a period of time as a QBasic sample program.

                    An analog joystick-controlled variant of Snake, called Anaconda, was included as a hidden minigame
                    in
                    TimeSplitters 2, which featured free rotation instead of a fixed 4-direction system, and multiple
                    types
                    of
                    food.
                </p>


                <p>
                    More recent versions include a Neopets version known as Meerca Chase. Snake can be played on YouTube
                    videos
                    that use the 2010 version of the player. When a video is selected, the user can press the 'left'
                    key,
                    the
                    'right' key, the 'home' key, or the 'end' key for any period of time before immediately pressing the
                    'up'
                    key. The game will appear and can be played in the videoscreen. Until 2012, a version called Old
                    Snakey
                    could be played inside Gmail</p>
